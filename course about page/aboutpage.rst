Your course registration page is more than an overview; it’s a marketing page. This is where prospective students from all over the world decide whether to register, so it should inspire and inform, tell students why they should take it, what they will get out of it, and what’s required to succeed. This page can also be used as a template. Just replace the “Best Practices” column with your content. **Please be sure to follow the character and word limits given to you.**
TO DELIVER ASSETS: export this document, complete content, then zip together all the images along with the final text and send to your edX program manager. **Post About video only to edx-ftp.mit.edu (see specs under Video and Image Checklist).**
