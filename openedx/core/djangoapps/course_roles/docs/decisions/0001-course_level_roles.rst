1. Course Level Roles
######################


Status
******

**Provisional** *2023-09-13*

The status will be updated to *Accepted* upon completion of reimplementation.

Context
*******

There is currently no single functionality being used by the majority of the codebases that are a part of the Open edX ecosystem
that allows for adding roles (permission sets) that grant course related access for a user and can:

- be assigned at the course level 

- be assigned as an org-wide role (granting access to all courses within the org)

- be assigned as an instance-wide role (granting access to all courses that are within the instance)

- provide the flexibility to allow users to edit or create new roles (permission sets) that can be assigned to users


Decision
********

New LMS tables and solution - within LMS/CMS
------------------------------------------------

- We will add new tables to manage roles, permission, and users that are assigned to roles.

- We will add additional tables, if necessary, to manage custom roles.

- We will create the new tables within the current DB schema and LMS/CMS repo.

Rejected Alternatives
*********************

Current LMS table and solution
------------------------------
**Overview:**

- Utilize the existing DB table (`student_courseaccessrole`) in the LMS schema to assign users to roles.

- Add additional tables as needed to manage roles, permission sets, and groups of users that are assigned to roles.

- Additional tables would need to be added to manage role permissions (to accommodate custom roles).

- The tables and code would live within the current LMS schema and LMS/CMS repo.

**Pros:**

- Builds upon current solution.

- Allows for flexibility of permission sets.

- Iterative - Does not require front-loading engineering work before seeing a “benefit” from the users point of view.

**Cons:**

- Only focuses on course level roles.

- Potential latency issues for LMS API calls (reason referenced for why edx-rbac is using cookies).

- Not distributed (removes currently existing positive aspect of edx-rbac).

- Adds code to mono-repo.

- There is a higher risk to negatively impact user experience when modifying in use code.


Modified Current LMS table and solution - new IDA
-------------------------------------------------
**Overview:**

- Utilize the concepts behind the existing course level roles (and db table), but creates the table structure in a separate db/schema.

- Begins creating an IDA for authorization.

**Pros:**

- Greatest amount of flexibility.

- Easy to create new roles and add custom roles.

- Users can be assigned groups that are assigned roles or be assigned roles directly.

**Cons:**

- Requires largest amount of work.

- Adds yet another (at least the fourth) way to add roles to Open edX.

- Requires large amount of work before initial value added.
