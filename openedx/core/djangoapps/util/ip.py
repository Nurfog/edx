# .. setting_name: CLIENT_IP_HEADERS
# .. setting_default: []
# .. setting_description: A list of header/index pairs to use for determining the client's IP
#   address. Each entry is a map like ``{'name': 'X-Forwarded-For', 'index': -2}``. This will
#   control how the client's IP address is determined for attribution, tracking, rate-limiting,
#   or other general-purpose needs.
#
#   The named header must contain a list of IP addresses separated by commas, with whitespace
#   tolerated around each address. (The list must contain at least one address.) The index is
#   used for a Python list lookup, e.g. 0 is the first element and -2 is the second from the end.
#   Header/index pairs will be tried in turn and if none yields a result (header missing or index
#   out of range) or the list is empty, then the client IP will instead be drawn from
#   ``X-Forwarded-For`` and ``REMOTE_ADDR``.
#
#   Deployers using a single local proxy (e.g. a Tutor installation with caddy acting as reverse
#   proxy, and the LMS or CMS otherwise directly exposed to the internet) will likely be fine
#   with the default behavior.
#
#   For deployments behind a CDN, there may be a CDN-specific header to use. For example,
#   Cloudflare provides ``CF-Connecting-IP``. In this case, a setting of
#   ``[{'name': 'CF-Connecting-IP', 'index': 0}]`` would be the most appropriate choice.
#
#   Migrations from one network configuration to another may be accomplished by first adding the
#   new header to the list, making the networking change, and then removing the old one.
# .. setting_warnings: Changes to the networking configuration that are not coordinated with
#   this setting may allow callers to spoof their IP address.
