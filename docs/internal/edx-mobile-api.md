# edx-api

## Overview

**edx-api** is a MVP API contract to support the development
of a MVP Mobile Application. This API will only support the
following use cases

- Signup
- Login
- Enroll/Unenroll in course
- Get list of enrolled courses

IMPORTANT: This API contract was specifically designed to cover
the short term goals to support a MVP mobile client. This API will
be replaced by more long term API's that are currently in a design
phase (as of 11/26/2014). These API designs are visible for public
review at docs.edxapi.apiary.io.

The amount of data returned to the client will be restricted
to only contain information for these use cases. For example,
the "get course navigational items" method will not - say - 
return due dates or gradable related information.

This document is a design document and will not delve into the
implementation of this API contract

## HTTP Headers

There are two HTTP headers that are defined in the API contract:

| header | value |
| ------ | ----- |
| **X-edx-api-key** | shared secret between client and server. This identifies the calling software |
| **Authorization** | Bearer <access-token> |

This API will use OAuth2 for authentication. The access token
reflects the OAuth2 token that will be returned when calling
'access_token' method (see below).


## General Notes
Unauthenticated access will return a HTTP 403 status code. All
successful API calls will return HTTP Status code 200. Errors
will return a different status code that will be documented for
each method.

## Functional Endpoints

### Authentication

The following methods are related to user identity and
authentication. These only support authentication against the
Django-based user database.

##### Signup

Signup creates a new Open edX user in the database. Since we are
using OAuth2 as the authentication provider, after the signup
is completed, API clients will have to call into the
login method to get an OAuth2 security token

**Request: HTTPS POST /edx-api/signup/v1/register**


```
application/json
{
	"email": "foo@bar.com",
	"username": "foobar",
	"full_name": "Foo Bar",
	"password": "password"
}
```

**Response: Success**

```
StatusCode: 200
```

**Response: Missing Parameter**

```
StatusCode: 400
application/json
{
	"err_type": "MissingParameter",
	"err_msg": "Missing required parameters"
}
```

**Response: User Already Exists**

```
StatusCode: 400
application/json
{
	"err_type": "UserAlreadyExists",
	"err_msg": "User Already Exists"
}
```

**Response: Invalid Email**

This is returned if the email provided does
not appear to be a well formed email address
```
StatusCode: 400
application/json
{
	"err_type": "InvalidEmail",
	"err_msg": "Email provided is invalid"
}
```

**Response: Invalid Password**

This is returned if the password does not meet
password policy requirements
```
StatusCode: 400
application/json
{
	"err_type": "InvalidPassword",
	"err_msg": "Password provided is invalid"
}
```

##### Login

This uses the OAuth2 provider for Django (django-oauth2-provider).
As such it uses a slightly different HTTP POST Body format
(application/x-www-form-urlencoded rather than JSON)

**Request: HTTPS POST /edx-api/auth/v1/oauth2/access_token**

```
application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&
grant_type=password&username=YOUR_USERNAME&password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

**Response: success**

```
StatusCode: 200
application/json
{
	"access_token": "<your-access-token>", 
	"scope": "read", 
	"expires_in": 86399, 
	"refresh_token": "<your-refresh-token>"
}
```

**Response: Invalid email or password**

```
@TODO (need to look at django-oauth2-provider)
```
