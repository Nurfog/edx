Example of an OLX Course
########################

OLX is a flexible system that you can use to create edX courses in many ways.
While there is no best way to structure courses in all situations, there are
best practices that help make an OLX course easier to create and maintain.

In this section, we use a course, edX-Insider, as an example of how to create
an OLX course. We examine the overall structure of edX-Insider, as well as how
the coursware is defined.

The files for `edX-Insider`_ are stored in GitHub, so you can explore how the course is made for yourself.

See the following chapters for more information.
